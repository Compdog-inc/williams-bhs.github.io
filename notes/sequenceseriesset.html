      <h2>Sequence</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>sequence</strong> is an ordered list of terms. Sequences can be <strong>finite</strong> or
        <strong>infinite</strong>. Sequences can be listed or defined in a variety of ways. Here are some sequences:
        \[1,1,1,1,1,...\]
        \[2,4,6,8,10\]
        \[1,1,2,3,5,8,...\]
        \[0, 0.01, 0.0011, 0.000111, 0.00001111, ... \]
        \[\frac{0}{1},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{1}\]
        The ellipses (...) indicate that the sequence continues.
      </p>

      <h3>Formulating Sequences</h3>
      <p>
        An <strong>explicit formula</strong> is one that calculates the \(n^{\text{th}}\) term of a sequence directly.
        The \(n^{\text{th}}\) perfect square is given by
        \[a_n = n^2 \]
        for \(n \geq 1\).
        The subscript is an index which refers to a particular term in a sequence. It is common to start with subscripts
        of either 0 or 1. The sequence defined by the formula above is \(a_1, a_2, a_3, ...\), where:
        \[a_1 = 1\]
        \[a_2 = 4\]
        \[a_3 = 9\]
        \[...\]
      </p>
      <p>
        A <strong>recursive definition</strong> consists of an <strong>initial condition</strong> and <strong>recurrence
          relation</strong> for calculating each term from previous terms. Consider:
        \[a_1 = \frac{1}{2}\]
        \[a_n = 3a_{n-1}\]
        This says that every term is equal to \(3\) times the previous term, with the first term being
        \(\frac{1}{2}\). This definition gives us the sequence:
        \[a_{1} = \frac{1}{2}\]
        \[a_{2} = \frac{3}{2}\]
        \[a_{3} = \frac{9}{2}\]
        \[a_{4} = \frac{27}{2}\]
      </p>

      <p>
      <div class="exercise">
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>Find \(a_6\) in the sequence defined by \(a_n = 2a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}\) with \(a_0 = 3\) and \(a_1=4\).</p>
        <button onclick="toggleSolution(this)" class="exercise-button">Show Solution</button>
        <div class="solution">
          <p>
            To find \(a_6\) we would need:
            \[ a_6 = 2a_5 - a_4 \]
            but we do not know \(a_5\) or \(a_4\) yet. The typical strategy for evaluating terms recursivly is to start
            at the beginning and work up to our target term.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are given:
            \[a_0 = 3\]
            \[a_1 = 4\]
            and we continue with:
            \[a_2 = 2 \cdot 4 - 3 = 5 \]
            \[a_3 = 2 \cdot 5 - 4 = 6 \]
            \[a_4 = 2 \cdot 6 - 5 = 7 \]
            \[a_5 = 2 \cdot 7 - 6 = 8 \]
            \[a_6 = 2 \cdot 8 - 7 = 9 \]

        <h3>Sequence Behavior</h3>
        <p>
          For an infinite sequence, a natural question regards the behavior of \(a_n\) as \(n\) goes to infinty.
          There are some common behaviors we want to be able to recognize and analyize.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some sequences will just get bigger, tending toward \(\pm \infty\), for example:
          \[1,2,3,4,5,...\]
          \[2,4,6,8,10,...\]
          \[-2, -3, -5, -7, -11, -13, ...\]
          \[\sqrt{1}, \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{4}, ...\]
        </p>
        <p>
          Other sequences <strong>converge</strong> to a single number. Cosider these sequences:
          \[ \frac{1}{1},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{5},\frac{1}{6}, ... \]
          \[1, 0.1, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, ...\]
          \[ \frac{1}{1}, \frac{2}{2^2}, \frac{3}{3^2}, \frac{4}{4^2} \]
          For all of these sequences, \(a_n \to 0\) as \(n \to \infty\), or using <strong>limit notation</strong>:
          \[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0 \]
        </p>
        <p>
          Other sequences <strong>cycle</strong>. The sequence given by:
          \[a_0 = 3 \quad \quad a_n = -1 a_{n-1}\]
          is the alternating sequence:
          \[3, -3, 3, -3, 3, ...\]
          We would call this a \(2\)-cycle since it cycles between two values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other sequences do not cycle, converge, or go off to infinity. The sequence of digits in \(\pi\) are
          values from \(0\) to \(9\) that do not converge and do not cycle.
        </p>

        <h2>Sum</h2>
        <p>
          We will find several applications that sum the terms of a sequence. Even infinite sequences! Given the
          infinite sequence:
          \[ \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, ... \]
          The corresponding sum is:
          \[ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + ... \]
          which amazingly is an infinite sum equal to \(1\).
          A formula for this sequence of reciprocal powers of \(2\) is:
          \[ a_n = \frac{1}{2^n} \quad \quad n \geq 1 \]
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sigma notation</strong> uses \(\sum\) to represent a summation. The summation of the infinite sequence
          above could be written as:
          \[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^n} \]
          where the subscript \(n=1\) represents the starting value of \(n\) and the superscript represents the final
          value.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can also write sums of finite sequences or <strong>partial sums</strong> of infinite sequences. Here is the
          sum of the first five perfect squares:
          \[\sum_{i=1}^{5} x^2 = (1)^2 + (2)^2 + (3)^2 + (4)^2 + (5)^2\]
        </p>

        <h2>Sets</h2>
        <!-- Modified from https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/pdfs/dmoi3-tablet.pdf -->
        <p>
          A set is an unordered collection of objects. Consider the set of books with two-word titles, the set of prime
          numbers, or the set of english words that are spelled the same forwards as backwards. Imagine the set of all
          sets that have three elements in them. The foundation of mathematics is built with sets.
        </p>
        <p>
          For us, we will consider sets that look like this:
          \[A = \{1,2,3\}\]
          This is read, "A is the set containing the elements 1, 2, and 3." We use curly braces to enclose elements of a
          set.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can write:
          \[a \in \{a,b,c\} \]
          to say that \(a\) "is an element of" the set. It would also be true to say that \(d\) is not in the set, or:
          \[ d \notin \{a,b,c\} \]
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>Relationships Between Sets</h3>
        <p>
          Two sets are equal if they have exactly the same elements. For exmaple,
          \[\{1,2,3\}=\{2,1,3\} \]
        </p>
        <p>
          What about the sets \(A =\{1,2,3\}\) and \(B=\{1,2,3,4\}\)? Clearly \(A \neq B\), but notice that every
          element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\). Because of this, we say that \(A\) is a <strong>subset</strong>
          of \(B\), or in symbols \(A \subset B\) or \(A \subseteq B\). Both symbols are read "is a subset of." The
          difference is that sometimes we want to say that \(A\) is either equal to or is a subset of \(B\), in which
          case we use \(\subseteq\). This is anlaogous to the difference between \(<\) and \(\leq\). </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>cardinality</strong> of a set is the size of a set, and is equal to the number of elements in
              the set. If set \(A\) has \(3\) elements then we say that \(|A|=3\).
            </p>
            <p>
              We call the set of all subsets of \(A\) the <strong>power set</strong> of \(A\). For \(A=\{1,2,3\}\), the
              power set \(\mathcal{P}(A) = \{ \{\},\{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\} \}\)
            </p>
